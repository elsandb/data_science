# The LEGO dataset

### Data aggregation and merging with pandas, visualisation with matplotlib


The small plastic building bricks from the Danish company LEGO, are popular with children of ALL ages. On day 73 of "[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)" we looked at a dataset about LEGO and the history of the company's product offering. The csv files used, were provided in the course lesson. The data was obtained from [Rebrickable's database](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) in late 2020 (i.e., 2019 is the last year with complete data).
